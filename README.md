# Blob Classes

Implementation of a set of Blob classes as described in [the blog article](https://www.dominikgrabiec.com/c++/2023/04/28/ever_useful_blob_class.html). These classes will work in Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 and should also work in other compilers.

To use these classes you'll need to implement some sort of `ASSERT` macro, though easiest might be to use [my ASSERT macro](https://www.dominikgrabiec.com/c++/2023/02/28/making_a_flexible_assert.html) available from [Github](https://github.com/DominikGrabiec/Assert).
